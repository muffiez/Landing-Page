    <p>The Pomeranian, as we know it today, descended originally from the Spitz family of dogs in the frozen Arctic region of Iceland.</p>

    <p>The original Pomeranians were white, black, brown and parti-colored. The red and orange colors were quite rare at that time.</p>

    <p>In 1900 the American Kennel Club recognized the Pomeranian and the American Pomeranian Club (APC) was formed. In 1909 APC was accepted as a Member Club of the AKC and became the designated Parent Club for the breed.</p>

    <p>This little compact toy dog does not realize that it is such a small dog. Pomeranians are truly large dogs in a small dog body. They have a vivacious spirit with a foxlike expression. They are playful throughout the majority of their lives, but are also happy to simply hang out on the couch or in your lap.</p>
